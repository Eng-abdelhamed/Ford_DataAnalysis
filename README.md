# Ford GoBike

Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area,
California. Beginning operation in August 29th 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share,
the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco,
East Bay and San Jose. From it's early development, many other cities began adopting this system.
This is the link for the dataset https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html.
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area.
Our goal as a data analyst, is to increase it's rideship and to offer deals through the mobile app. What deals can be offered?
Currently, it has three options: a flat price for a single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours and an annual membership
 In addition to using bicycles, Ford has introduced electric bikes called Ford GoBike Plus (ebike) https://www.fordgobike.com/how-it-works/meet-the-bike.
